This directory contains the implementation of a client-server remote procedure call.<br>
In this, there are two programs P and Q which are the client and server respectively.<br>
Three different procedures are implemented in Q and called remotely from P as follows:
- One procedure accepts an integer, increments it and returns the result.
- Another procedure accepts a floating point and an integer, squares the floating point and adds the integer and then returns the result.
- The third procedure accepts a string, reverse it and returns the result.
